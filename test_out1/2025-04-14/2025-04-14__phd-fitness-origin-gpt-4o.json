Add eggs, Greek yogurt, or protein shake.\n>\n> - **Improve Dinner Composition**  \n>   > Swap processed items (chicken pot pie) with grilled protein + roasted veg + complex carb like quinoa, lentils, or brown rice.\n>\n> - **Hydration Support**  \n>   > Sparkling water is fine, but consider an electrolyte tab 1x/day (like LMNT or Nuun) to support mineral intake.\n````\n\nLet me know if you want:\n- Recipes for any of these suggestions.\n- A structured grocery list.\n- Or a meal plan mockup.\n\nReady to build your workout plan next?"
