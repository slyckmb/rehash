All workout entries were revised to match formatting, sequencing, and machine step rules.\n\n- **Real-Time Logging of Week 5 Workouts**  \n  - \ud83d\udfe2 **W5D1, W5D2, W5D3** were fully executed and recorded live with biometric overlays, set-by-set tracking, and RPE values.\n  - Each session included real-time HR input, AMRAP sets, cooldown taper calculations, and retrospective comparisons to prior performance.\n\n- **Machine-Based Max Zone System**  \n  You introduced or reinforced a canonical max-load reference for each machine. All set 4s were explicitly restructured to hit or exceed max zones within safe RPE limits.\n\n- **Equipment Guardrails**  \n  Machines used were strictly validated against your equipment list (e.g. Hoist RS-1403, RS-2601). Non-listed machines were flagged and excluded.\n\n- **Post-Workout Log Formatting**  \n  Markdown logs were finalized with:\n  - Machine IDs\n  - Weight \u00d7 reps \u00d7 RPE structure\n  - HR delta and cooldown analysis\n  - Coach's notes + GPT summaries\n  - Markdown output in 4- or 5-tick fenced blocks\n\n- **Historical Chat Rehydration**  \n  You re-uploaded and reconstructed earlier logs using Apple Watch `.csv` files and exported `.json` chats. When chat memory was incomplete, you initiated deep memory scans (e.g. 05-15-2025).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 **Technical Adjustments Made**\n\n- Refined machine step logic from equipment matrices (e.g., Leg Press 20 lb steps)  \n- Updated \u201cGlute Kickback\u201d inclusion after verifying RS-1412 in equipment list  \n- Rebuilt legacy logs (Week 5 Day 2, Day 3) using chat-only reconstructions  \n- Managed cooldown HR recovery tracking (\u0394 HR used as biomarker for taper)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd2c **Performance Highlights**\n\n- **Leg Press:** Surpassed 275 lb max \u2192 280\u00d725  \n- **Cable Crunch:** New peak \u2192 205\u00d714  \n- **Seated Leg Curl:** Adjusted max from 110 \u2192 160\u00d714  \n- **Pull-Up Assist:** Maintained step-down tension to 165\u00d711  \n- **Obliques:** Balanced progression \u2192 145\u00d720/side\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc1 **Repository & Structure**\n\n- All logs named with ISO date + day markers (e.g. `WorkoutLog_Week5_Day3_2025-05-17`)  \n- Logs cross-referenced to templates and max load matrices  \n- Files exported as `.md`, and full structure maintained for repo commits\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a structured `.md` summary of this recap, or if you want to initiate Week 6 planning or macro progression design."
