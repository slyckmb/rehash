It was added intentionally to enhance medial delt work, which wasn\u2019t isolated much in prior logs.\n\nLet me know if you'd prefer a swap for Lateral Raise \u2014 I can replace it with Upright Row (RS-1408) or another machine you used."

        "Excellent question \u2014 especially since you're following a **machine-only hypertrophy protocol** under strict equipment constraints.\n\n### Why split Push/Pull?\n\n**Traditionally**, the push/pull split:\n- Reduces muscle overlap fatigue (e.g., biceps not exhausted the day before back)\n- Organizes training by movement pattern (push = chest/triceps/delts, pull = back/biceps)\n- Helps manage CNS and recovery rhythm over the week\n\nBut in your context \u2014 where:\n- All work is **machine-guided**\n- Volume and RPE are tightly tracked\n- You\u2019re training **3x/week with total control over sets, load, rest**\n\n### The push/pull split isn't essential.\n\nIn fact, you might benefit more from a **\"movement-balance split\"** like:\n\n- **Day 1:** Horizontal push + vertical pull  \n- **Day 2:** Legs + posterior chain  \n- **Day 3:** Vertical push + horizontal pull + core\n\nThat way:\n- You still hit every major group 2x/week\n- You reduce redundancy (no \u201cChest Press + Pec Fly\u201d combos)\n- You align better with equipment availability\n\nWant me to use that smarter balance instead of push/pull for Week 4? It\u2019s more effective for your actual setup."

Notes frequently mention clean form, effective muscle targeting, and no RPE regressions. You're staying within recovery capacity.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Advice & Strategic Direction\n\n- **Add Mild Intensity Cycling:**  \n  Include **1 RPE 9+ finisher set** per session (once/week per muscle group) to drive new adaptations while still recovering fully.\n\n- **Exercise Rotation (every 3\u20134 weeks):**  \n  Begin subbing out 1\u20132 main machines every 4th week. For example: swap **Mid Row for Lat Pulldown**, or **Glute Master for Leg Curl variations** if listed in your equipment file.\n\n- **Progression Focus Next Week:**  \n  Based on your strength ceiling:\n  - Chest Press \u2192 Target 135 lb \u00d7 8 @ RPE \u2264 8.0  \n  - Shoulder Press \u2192 Push to 100 lb top set  \n  - Crunch (RS-2601) \u2192 Maintain volume but add **2s pause** at contraction peak\n\n- **Add Movement-Based Warmups:**  \n  Your HR curves suggest short warmups. Try 2\u20133 ramp sets per session (esp. leg day) to enhance readiness and reduce injury risk.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Readiness for Week 4\n\n- Recovery: **Excellent**  \n- Effort Control: **Dialed in**  \n- HR + Load Consistency: **Optimal**\n- You are cleared and primed for:\n  - Higher RPE exposure (selectively)\n  - Volume maintenance (~20 sets)\n  - Strategic overload (not random)\n\nReady to roll into **Week 4 Day 2 \u2014 Legs + Posterior Chain** when you are.\n````"
