        "On the Apple Watch, the difference between **Functional Strength Training** and **Traditional Strength Training** primarily affects how the watch interprets and categorizes your movements, calorie burn, and heart rate response:\n\n### **Functional Strength Training**  \n- Designed for **multi-joint, full-body movements**, often involving coordination, balance, and core stability.  \n- Examples: kettlebell swings, TRX, battle ropes, medicine ball throws, CrossFit-style circuits, etc.  \n- The watch allows for **greater movement variability** and assumes **less static positioning**.  \n- Ideal if you're using **machines like Hoist ROC-IT** or performing **dynamic machine-to-machine transitions**.\n\n### **Traditional Strength Training**  \n- Assumes more **stationary**, **compound or isolation lifts**, often with **rest between sets**.  \n- Examples: barbell bench press, seated bicep curls, machine chest press.  \n- Apple Watch uses a model expecting **repetitive static load** and more predictable heart rate profiles.\n\n### Recommendation for You  \nGiven your use of **Hoist and Matrix machines** (especially with the dynamic ROC-IT system), **Functional Strength Training** is more accurate for:\n\n- Capturing the semi-dynamic nature of the machines  \n- Reflecting movement variability  \n- Estimating calories and effort more fairly\n\nWould you like this added as a note to your `gear-guide.md` or `tracking-notes.md` file?"
