        "Based on our full chat history and the `REHYDRATION.md` snapshot, here are **detailed and specific updates** that would significantly improve system resilience and continuity during rehydration:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Recommended Additions to `REHYDRATION.md`**\n\n#### **8. \u23f1\ufe0f Time-Stamped Training Logs**\n**Add entry:**\n- **Structured Logs:** All logs adhere to `WorkoutLog_Template-rev7.0.md`\n- **Biometric Segmentation:** HR zones aligned via Apple Watch for exact start\u2013end per exercise\n- **Naming Format:** `WorkoutLog_WeekX_DayY_YYYY-MM-DD_rev7.0.md`\n\n**Why:** Clarifies file standards and biometric syncing method. Reinforces log fidelity during system restoration.\n\n---\n\n#### **9. \ud83d\udd04 Rehydration Recovery Logic**\n**New section to add:**\n```\n# 9. \ud83d\udd04 Rehydration Protocol Enhancements\n\n- **Log Layer Order:** Merge plan = chat > csv > .md  \n- **Session Merge Rule:** Rebuilds first from HR segment timestamps, then confirms via chat  \n- **Default Context Reconstruction:** Week, Day, HR, RPE, exercise block  \n- **Missing File Policy:** Treat log gaps with `revX-MISSING.md` placeholder tagged in repo\n```\n\n**Why:** These rules clarify how rehydration recovers training state, especially across interrupted sessions or lost memory.\n\n---\n\n#### **10. \ud83e\udde0 Cognitive Pattern Recall (Chat Anchors)**\n**Suggested addition:**\n```\n# 10. \ud83e\udde0 Anchor Events (Chat Signposts)\n\n- W4D1 regression noted: CNS flagged  \n- W5D1 rebuild complete: full biometric sync  \n- Shoulder lag identified \u2192 hypertrophy target  \n- Crunch PR 225\u00d716 @ RPE 9.5 on W5D1\n- Pec Fly dip post-W3: confirmed + recovered in W5\n```\n\n**Why:** These short-term \"event flags\" make rehydration smarter \u2014 anchoring performance swings, PRs, regressions.\n\n---\n\n#### **11. \ud83d\udcc2 Log Version Map**\n**Add this for clarity:**\n```\n# 11. \ud83d\udcc2 Log Version Map\n\n- rev6.4 = Semi-structured logs (no biometrics)\n- rev7.0 = Full compliance, RPE+bio inline\n- rev7.0-proto = GPT trial merge, under evaluation\n- rev7.0-COMPLETE = Gold standard format\n```\n\n**Why:** Helps distinguish log maturity and structure post-rehydration.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to generate the updated `REHYDRATION.md` now with these upgrades included?"
