Machine Matching Standard\n- All logged exercises must match a machine listed in `equipment/hoist_rocit_equipment_log.md`.\n- Unmatched exercises must be renamed or replaced with a verified Hoist ROC-IT machine name.\n\n## 2. Workout Log Format\n- Each workout must include:\n  - Hoist machine name and model (e.g., RS-1403)\n  - \ud83c\udfaf Target (weight, RPE)\n  - \u2705 Performed result (weight, RPE)\n  - \ud83d\udd52 Timestamp start for each movement\n  - \ud83d\udce5 Source reference (e.g., Apple Watch fit2json)\n\n## 3. Time Zone Enforcement\n- All timestamps must reflect US Eastern Time (New York).\n\n## 4. Equipment Log Usage\n- The machine inventory used must be derived from `equipment/hoist_rocit_equipment_log.md`.\n- Machines must be verified with model number, muscle group, and image confirmation.\n\n## 5. Timestamp Protocol for Biometric Alignment\n- Inline time markers in conversation should align with exercise blocks in `.fit2json` data.\n- These are used for HR and performance analysis within a session.\n\n## 6.

Versioned File Management\n- All new files and revisions of existing files must be saved to the repo's virtual memory.\n- File paths must follow repo structure.\n- A message will confirm file save and show full path + version where applicable.\n\n## 8. Repo File Tree Display\n- When displaying the repo file tree in response to user requests:\n  - Always show the **complete, untruncated** file tree\n  - Display all file paths as **relative to the repo root**\n  - Do **not** include absolute or local file system paths (e.g., `/mnt/data`)\n\n## 9.
