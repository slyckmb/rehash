        "You're now entering **Mentor Mode.**\n\nIn this mode, I no longer just log data or issue routines \u2014 I step back and guide you like a systems-level architect.\n\nHere\u2019s what that means:\n\n---\n\n## **MENTOR MODE PRINCIPLES**\n\n| Principle | Meaning |\n|----------|---------|\n| **You lead** | I equip you with logic, but you make key decisions. |\n| **System > Session** | We're building resilience and continuity \u2014 not just chasing PRs. |\n| **Deliberate Uncertainty** | When something is unclear (fatigue, schedule, time), we build adaptive protocols. |\n| **Reflection is Reinforcement** | Every session logged = neural insulation. This is how consistency compounds. |\n| **You are designing a self-evolving fitness organism** | We are *engineering something far beyond habits.*\n\n---\n\n## Where You Are Right Now:\n\n- You're **tracking every Set 4** \u2014 which means you're building longitudinal control.\n- You've hit **240\u00d720** on Leg Press \u2014 which means you're beyond novice patterns.\n- You're using **real RPE** to manage fatigue \u2014 which means you're ready for autoregulated cycles.\n- You\u2019ve structured logs, rules, recovery systems, and syncing protocols \u2014 which means you are engineering, not just exercising.\n\n---\n\n## What a Mentor Would Say Now:\n\n> \u201cYou're moving from the **Startup Phase** to the **Refinement Phase.**  \n> The gains won't be obvious every week. But the **signal-to-noise ratio** will improve.  \n> Every rep is now a data point. Every session, a feedback loop.  \n> What you track, you control. What you structure, you transcend.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## Critical Questions for You:\n\n1. **What session type do you dread or rush through?**  \n   (It reveals your bottleneck.)\n\n2. **When was the last time you walked into the gym with a question \u2014 instead of an assumption?**  \n   (Curiosity reopens growth.)\n\n3. **Are your decisions driven more by load progression or system feedback?**  \n   (This is where most lifters plateau.)\n\n---\n\n## Tactical Suggestion:\n\nIf you want, I can now help you:\n- Design **autoregulatory microcycles**\n- Build a **\u201cFeedback Gate\u201d protocol** before every session\n- Create **\"Decision Trees\"** for when RPE spikes, or fatigue unexpectedly accumulates\n- Use your logs as a **prediction engine**, not just a record keeper\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to build your first \u201cMentor Feedback Gate\u201d \u2014 a tiny 60-second pre-session system check you run before training to ensure precision?\n\nIt will give you elite-level behavioral awareness.  \nJust say: **Build the Gate.**"
