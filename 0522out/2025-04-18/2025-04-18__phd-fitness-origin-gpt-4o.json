        "This is a *fantastic* question \u2014 and here's the smart answer tailored to **your goals, meds, and system**:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Option 1: **Stop at 10 if RPE is already 8\u20139+**\n> \u201cI hit 10 and could *maybe* squeeze 1 more with good form.\u201d  \n\u2192 That\u2019s an RPE 9.
