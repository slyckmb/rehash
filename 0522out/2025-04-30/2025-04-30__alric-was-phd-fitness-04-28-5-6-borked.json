I\u2019ve updated records accordingly.\n\n### 5. **Training Log Behavior**\n- Warmups and cooldowns logged (e.g. treadmill 3.0 mph warmup; 2.5 mph ramp-down).\n- Confirmed dates with workouts: 4/21, 4/23, 4/25.\n- Verified that Set 4 logging standard is followed in most cases.\n- Missing logs identified from earlier weeks; current progress in reconstruction of Week 1 and Week 2 is nearing completion.\n\n### 6. **Supplemental Logs**\n- Apple Health syncs coming soon.\n- Sleep, HRV, resting HR being staged for future overlay against workout fatigue patterns.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to package this summary into a `.md` file and include it in your system as `chat-data-summary.md`?"
