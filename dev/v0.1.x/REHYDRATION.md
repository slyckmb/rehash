## 📜 Initial Mission Setup

- Mode Activated: **App Generator Mode**
- Goals:  
  - Parse and manipulate ChatGPT export archives or folders.
  - List conversations.
  - Filter and export selected conversations.
  - Maintain strict CLI/UX standards.
  - Prioritize extendability and code quality.

## 🛠️ Major Directives Accepted

| Directive | Details |
|:---------:|:-------:|
| CLA Minimalism | Command Line Args as tight and intuitive as possible. |
| PATH First | Always specify export path first if given. |
| Filter by Fields | Full JMESPath-based filtering. |
| Conversation Export | Export single conversations by ID (allow JSON/YAML). |
| Timestamped Output | Script name, version, timestamp, CLI invocation echoed at start. |
| Strict Help/Usage | Auto display perfect usage if anything wrong. |
| Partial ID Matching | Accept partial (prefix) ID match if unique; warn if ambiguous. |
| `--filter help` | Dump filterable fields with examples without parsing JSON. |
| Minimal Req Doc Revisions | Treat original Req Doc as sacred, diff-patch any edits. |

## 📦 Files Created During Session

| Filename | Description |
|:--------:|:------------:|
| `rehash.py` | Core Python CLI tool. |
| `rehash_requirements.v0.1.4-REV1.md` | Original locked requirements spec. |
| `testdata/` | Test data folder for conversations.json etc. |
| `.venv_name` | Virtual environment marker. |
| `README.md` | Usage documentation (initial). |

## 🔥 Session Critical Events Timeline

| Step | Event | Comment |
|:----:|:-----:|:-------:|
| INIT | Requirements spec started. | 🧠 Canonical rules enforced. |
| BUILD1 | rehash.v0.1.1-BUILD1.py | Basic structure parsed, CLI running. |
| BUILD2 | Minor help tweaks. | Adjusted after first feedback. |
| BUILD3 | Full parsing rework | Still had modifier parsing bugs. |
| BUILD4 | Path-first logic enforced | No behavior fixes yet. |
| BUILD5 | Modifier logic FIXED | Filters, csv/tab/json/yaml working. |
| BUILD6 (Planned) | Add partial ID matching, timestamp, --filter help | Pending final LOCK command. |

---

## 📜 REQ DOC PATCHES IN ORDER

### v0.1.4-REV1
- Original canonical doc locked.

### v0.1.6-REV1 (ABANDONED)
- Rewrite attempt (rejected for violating minimal patch rules).

### v0.1.6-REV2 CLEAN
- ✅ Minimal patch.
- ✅ Path = folder or zip.
- ✅ --filter help added.
- ✅ Partial conversation ID matching.
- ✅ Timestamp always at startup.
- ✅ No structure destroyed.

---

## ✨ REHASH v0.1.6-REV2 CLEAN CLI Behavior (Expected Final State)

```
Usage:
  rehash [path] -l [full] [csv|tab] [--filter "expression"]
  rehash [path] -c CONVERSATION_ID [json|yaml]

Notes:
- [path] = folder or .zip archive. Default = .
- -l (list) or -c (conv) required.
- Modifiers must be space-separated words.
- Strings in filters need quotes.
- Numbers in filters need backticks.
- Use --filter help to see all fields.

Startup Echo:
- Script name
- Version
- UTC Timestamp
- CLI invocation

Partial ID Match:
- Full ID first
- Unique partial prefix allowed
- List matches with titles if ambiguous
```
